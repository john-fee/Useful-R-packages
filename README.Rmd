# Documenting data

- [codebookr](https://github.com/jfjelstul/codebookr)
- [codebook](https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/)

# Creating Documents

- [Creating document templates](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/document-templates.html)
  - This will be useful to create a default analysis document so we don't have to write boilerplate code to setup data access every time
- [bslib](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/)
  - Nice options for theming html documents produced by Rmd
  - Should work with `flexdashboard`!
- [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) and [reactablefmtr](https://kcuilla.github.io/reactablefmtr/)
  - The best options (I've found) for creating nice customizable tables for html documents.
- [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/)
  - Nice lightweight package for html/pdf documents
- [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)
  - Table making package which I've heard good things about - might be worth trying out
  
# Data processing

- `tidyverse` is generally useful, particularly `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `janitor`, `stringr`, and `readr`.
- [dtplyr](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/)
  - Provides `data.table` backend for `dplyr`
- [tidytable](https://github.com/markfairbanks/tidytable)
  - Provides implementation of `dplyr` syntax natively in `data.table`
- [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) is a really nice way to handle large datasets.  Is a good option too if you can't setup a dedicated database
- [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) is for when you *do* have to pull data out of databases, but don't want to write dplyr code rather than SQL.
  
# Plotting

- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
- [ggforce](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/)
  - A package with (lots of) extensions of to ggplot.  A good place to look first when something is a little awkward to do in base ggplot.
- [scales](https://scales.r-lib.org/)
  - I use this a lot to create nicely formatted ggplot axes, but also the functions are useful for generic formatting (e.g. I use `label_comma` often to format data for tables)
- [cowplot](https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot)
  - Nice theme, some functions for arranging and sizing plots
- [ggpubr](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/)
  - Some nice shortcuts to make common plots good looking.  E.g. density plots with median reference lines and rugs, lollipop chart, etc.
  - Also has a nice theme to use
- [ggside](https://github.com/jtlandis/ggside)
  - Nice option to add side plots
- [ggmosaic](https://haleyjeppson.github.io/ggmosaic/index.html)
   - Package to produce mosaic plots, which I think are intuitive but sadly seem to be confusing initially to others
- [binsreg](https://nppackages.github.io/binsreg/)
  - A package for plotting binscatters, which is an interesting (nonparameteric) approach for visualizing relationships.  Not sure of the advantages vs splines though.
- [ggdist](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) A go-to library for communicating distributions,and uncertainty about distributions!
- [gghighlight](https://yutannihilation.github.io/gghighlight/) Convenient way to highlight only a few obs (saves some typing)
- [geomtextpath](https://github.com/AllanCameron/geomtextpath) Nice way to create labeled lines
- [ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) Extremely useful way to plot jittered labels and text
  
## Options to arrange plots within a multiplot

- [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)
- [gridExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html)
- `cowplot` has options
- [egg](https://github.com/baptiste/egg)f

## Color palettes

This isn't something I have been principled about - would be nice to leverage these and start!

- [microshades](https://karstenslab.github.io/microshades/)
  - Nice package for color-blind accessible palettes.  No ggplot themes built in (so this will require use the `scale_*_manual` functions), or some additional boilerplate to play nicely with ggplot.
- [palettes](https://tidytales.ca/posts/2022-12-20_palettes/)
  - A package for making a standardized color palette that plays nicely with various plotting libraries.  I should lean on this for custom palettes!


# Coding/Productivity

- [modules](https://wahani.github.io/modules/)
  - Provides an intermediate unit of code organization that is between a function and a package. Very useful if you want to organize code but don't have access to package development (`Rtools`)
- [zeallot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zeallot/index.html)
  - Provides packing and unpacking functionality similar to python's `zip` and `unzip`
- [magittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html)
  - The source of the pipe operator which is incorporated into the tidyverse.  Also has some operators like `%$%` (pipes in and exposes names - like using `with`) and some aliases for operations to make them easier to use with pipe-syntax
- [vtable](https://nickch-k.github.io/vtable/index.html)
  - Quick way to summarize data and expose data labels (Is there a way to integrate with other data documenting packages?)
- [unpivotr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unpivotr/index.html)
  - A very nice option for reading in Excel worksheets that are not designed to be machine readable
- [datapasta](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta)
  - A nice I/O library that helps get data into and out of R quickly!  Best for quick requests where a reproducible process isn't necessary - just up-front dev speed.
- [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) is a great tool for handling situations that would require loops.
- [furrr](https://furrr.futureverse.org/) is a good way to speed up `purrr` when needed


# Modeling

This section could conceivable take over the whole document, so I'm just going to list a few things that are relevant to me right now.

- The [easystats](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/) ecosystem
  - Not a single package, but a collection of packages (like the tidyverse) that work together to help with statistical modeling.  I would ideally like to lean on this more in the future.
- [marginaleffects](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/index.html)
  - A successor of sorts to the `emmeans` package.
- [ggeffects](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects)
  - Lightweight `ggplot` extension for calculating and plotting marginal effects
- [modelsummary](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/) is a cool package for reporting model results

## Survival analysis specific libraries

- `survival`
- `flexsurv`
- `ggsurvfit` provides ggplot visualizations for survival curves
- [condsurv](https://www.emilyzabor.com/condsurv/index.html) is a quick way to calculate and plot conditional survival
- [contsurvplot](https://robindenz1.github.io/contsurvplot/) is a useful package for visualizing the effect of continuous covariates on survival
